### Further Notes
In this project me and my teammate created our first game using the MSP430F5529 Launchpad-based Lab Board. We were able to make a Simon program where a sequence of LEDS would light up, each with a different buzzer pitch, and a user would input corresponding numbers on the keypad to match the sequence. Every time a user would input the correct sequence, the sequence would be incremented with another LED and would get faster. We also configured the push buttons on the board to act as a reset button at any moment in the program. We implemented this using the C language and practiced using state machines, port configurations, and writing functions.
